# apple_books_to_md

Based on [this script](https://github.com/fabianmu/ibooks2markdown)

## What it does

It fetches all the highlights and notes from your Apple Books SQLite files and converts them into a Markdown (.md).

## What's the difference with the [original script](https://github.com/fabianmu/ibooks2markdown)

This is a slightly modified version that drops the Date and the note context and groups the notes by chapter.
